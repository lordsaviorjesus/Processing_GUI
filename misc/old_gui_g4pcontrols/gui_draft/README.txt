Here's the main library I used to design the basic GUI. There are some helpful
vids on the website listed below. A lot of the design was done useing the tool
listed below as well, which is a folder you drop into the tools folder in
Processing (instructions listed on the website)

The gui uses both sketch pde files to run.
